### Descriptive Set Theory

*   The study of "definable" set of reals.
    *   There are a couple of different things we will mean by "definable"
*   Themes:
    *   Arbitrary sets of reals may be "wild". "Definable" sets are "regular".
    *   "Definability" comes in a hierarchy of complexity.
    *   The line between "wild" and "regular" occurs somewhere in this hierarcy.
    *   The question of where in the hierarchy the line occurs turns out
        surprisingly and profoundly to be deeply connected to large cardinals.

### Existence of a non-measurable set.

**Theorem** There is a set of reals that is not Lebesgue Measurable.

Note: You need to know almost nothing about what Lebesgue measure is to
understand the proof.

**proof** We are going to construct a set 
$$A \subseteq [0, 1]$$ so that $$[0,1] = A_0 \cup A_1 \cup \cdots$$ 
where each $$A_n$$ is a rigid copy of $$A$$.
